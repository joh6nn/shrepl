shrepl(1) - sometimes you need a repl
===================================

## SYNOPSIS

`shrepl` <[shrepl-options]> <command> <...>

## DESCRIPTION

`shrepl` is a POSIX-shell--compliant clone of Chris Wanstrath's
`repl`. It wraps a non-interactive `command` in an interactive
read-eval-print-loop prompt. Each line you type into the prompt is
executed as arguments to `command`. Anything written to standard
output or standard error by the `command` is displayed.

If you have `rlwrap(1)` installed you'll automatically get the full
benefits of readline: history, reverse searches, etc.

`shrepl` is meant to wrap programs which accept command line arguments
and print to the standard output. It keeps no state between executed
lines and, as such, cannot be used to replace `irb` or the Python
REPL (for example).

## EXAMPLES

Using `shrepl` with `redis-cli`:

    $ shrepl redis-cli
    >> set name chris
    OK
    >> get name
    chris
    >> info
    redis_version:1.000
    uptime_in_seconds:182991
    uptime_in_days:2
    .. etc ..


Using `shrepl` with Ruby's `gem`:

    $ shrepl gem
    >> --version
    1.3.5
    >> search yajl

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***

    yajl-ruby (0.6.7)
    >> search yajl -r

    *** REMOTE GEMS ***

    brianmario-yajl-ruby (0.6.3)
    filipegiusti-yajl-ruby (0.6.4)
    jdg-yajl-ruby (0.5.12)
    oortle-yajl-ruby (0.5.8)
    yajl-ruby (0.6.7)


Using `shrepl` with `git`:

    $ shrepl git
    >> branch
      gh-pages
    * master
    >> tag
    rm
    v0.1.0
    v0.1.1
    v0.1.2
    v0.1.3
    >> tag -d rm
    Deleted tag 'rm'
    >> pwd
    git: 'pwd' is not a git-command. See 'git --help'.

## OPTIONS

  * `-h`, `--help`:
    Displays usage information.

  * `--stdin`:
    Pipe input to command's STDIN.

  * `--debug`:
    Displays debug information while running.

  * `--man`:
    Displays usage information. Present for compatability with `repl` only.

## COMPLETION

Because `rlwrap` supports completion, `shrepl` does too. Any file in
`~/.repl` matching the name of the command you start `shrepl` with will
be used for completion.

For instance, a file named `~/.repl/redis-cli` containing "get set
info" will cause "get", "set", and "info" to be tab completeable at
the `shrepl redis-cli` prompt.

The directory searched for completion files can be configured using
the `REPL_COMPLETION_DIR` environment variable.

## COMMAND HISTORY

Because `rlwrap` supports command history, `shrepl` does too. Any file in
`~/` matching the name of the command you start `shrepl` with prefixed
with a dot and suffixed with "_history" will be used for completion.

For instance, a file named `~/.redis-cli_history` containing a newline-
separated list of "get set info" will cause "get", "set", and "info"
to be reachable using the up arrow as command history at the `shrepl
redis-cli` prompt.

The directory searched for history files can be configured using the
`REPL_HISTORY_DIR` environment variable.

## ENVIRONMENT

### REPL_PROMPT

the prompt to display before each line of input.
defaults to >>

### REPL_COMPLETION_DIR

directory in which completion files are kept

### REPL_HISTORY_DIR

directory in which command history files are kept
